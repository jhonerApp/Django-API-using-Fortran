### Project Setup (Project name: Django restapi(Python) using fortran)

Calculations are implemented in **Fortran**, and a **Python** application is used to invoke these computations.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Fortran
- Django RestAPI framework
- Swagger
- WSL

## üêß WSL SETUP

1. Open WSL in VS code using ctrl + shift + P:

<div>
    <img src="./step/step1.png" alt="Next.js" />
<div>

2. Open the terminal and type the following command: <b>cd /mnt/d/Repository/Python/Fortran</b> (which is equivalent to <b>cd D:\Repository\Python\Fortran</b> on Windows). Then, type <b>code .</b> to open the project.

<div>
    <img src="./step/step2.png" alt="Next.js" />
<div>

3. After running the <b>code .</b> command, the project should open in VS Code. You‚Äôll see the project‚Äôs file name in the editor, indicating that it was successfully opened in WSL..

<div>

<div>

<br />

## Optional (If you want to change your system environment)

- Once you've successfully switched the terminal to Linux, type the command below to create a new environment folder. (This will allow you to run your application and install it in a separate environment).
    ```sh
     python -m venv <filename> or python3 -m venv <filename>
    ```
- Once the environment has been successfully added, activate it using the command below. <b>
source linux/bin/activate</b>. Then you will have a tag ex: <b>(linux) root@MSI:/mnt/d/Repository/Python/Fortran#</b>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="./step/step4.png" alt="Next.js"  />
</div>

## üì¶ Install the package and run the application
